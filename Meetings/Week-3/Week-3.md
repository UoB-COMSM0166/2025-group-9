# Week 3 Meeting

## Goals
This week we were tasked to:
- Make sure all our names are on the repo and upload a group photo
- Have an active Kanban board
- Create a paper prototype for each game and include videos
- Decide on a final game

## Space Invaders Potential additions/changes
- Switch from a space battle to a bird's-eye-view 2D jet fighter game.
- Implement a camera-based scrolling system to move a larger background map through the player's frame of reference to create the illusion of movement.
- Introduce ground targets that the player must drop bombs on to destroy. 
- Introduce a few fighter jets that the player must engage in aerial dogfights. During air combat, the player will have free movement in the 2D reference frame to evade and destroy enemy jets. 
- Introduce weather conditions such as icing (affects handling), turbulence (affects stability and control), wind (affects speed and control) and cloud cover (hides enemies or objectives, reduces target accuracy).
- Introduce altitude mechanics allowing players to ascend or descend to avoid mountain collisions, not crash into ocean, escape bad weather. Alitude may also tie into bombing mechanics, with bombs taking longer to hit targets at high altitude thus requiring players to consider timing. 
- Players are under a time constraint to complete mission to add urgency and strategic decision making. 
- Players are space constrained, going beyond the map counts as an abandoned mission and game over.
