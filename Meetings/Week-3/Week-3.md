## Fireboy & Watergirl Potential additions/changes
Switch from a space battle game to a co-op puzzle-platformer, where elemental siblings (Fire & Water) work together to solve temple challenges by combining their unique abilities. Here are some game ideas:
1. Deep Storyline & Character Development
- Add a background story explaining why Fireboy and Watergirl are in the temple.
- Introduce new characters and a main goal beyond simply progressing to the next level.
- Players uncover secrets of the temple as they progress.

2. Story-Driven Levels
- Levels evolve with the storyline, such as rescuing a character or revealing hidden temple lore.

3. Swappable & Merging Abilities
- Players can temporarily swap abilities, e.g., Fireboy gaining water abilities and vice versa.
- Parallel Worlds Mechanic: Players navigate two realms (Fire World & Water World) and must merge into a single character to solve         specific puzzles.

4. Time-Based Challenges
 - Introduce levels with time limits, requiring players to complete objectives before the countdown ends.
 - Include a race mode where players compete against each other to complete levels faster.

5. Math-Based Puzzles
 - Simple math challenges like arranging numbers or solving equations to unlock doors.

6. Dark Levels & Light Mechanics
 - Dark-themed levels where players must rely on limited light sources (e.g., fire or glowing objects) to navigate.

7. Ability Upgrades & Power-Ups
  - Players can upgrade abilities over time, such as faster movement and improved jumping height.
  - Introduce power-ups like speed boosts or temporary invincibility.

8. Gameplay Twists & New Mechanics
  - Board Rotation: Flip the entire level 180Â°, forcing players to adapt to a new perspective.
  - Timed Power Switches: Abilities swap automatically after a certain period, adding strategic complexity.
