# Week 7 Meeting
During Reading Week we started developing our game. We wanted to focus on the fundamental mechanics of the game first, so we divided the tasks up - Game Manager, Player, Floor class.


## Week 7 Lab
### Think Aloud:
1st tester:
- How can I move 
- Why i’m not moving
- He didn’t understand how to solve the puzzle
- How can I find the instructions 
- How to go back to the game (after instructions showed)
- User quickly was able to control both players. But then stuck to one of them. 
- User initially couldn’t find where to complete the task (puzzle area)
- User preferred to use the ASDF controls.
- User was able to finish the task.
- Suggested a need to increase the difficulty.
- Player was not left-handed but found it easy to navigate due to prior gaming experience


2nd tester
- the font is too small 
- I just have no idea what to do
- there are many icons that I’m not sure what they are
- Page shouldn’t move whenever the player moves
- Make the info text shorter
- Found it difficult to find where to complete the first puzzle
- Was able to complete the puzzle
- It’s difficult to jump onto the platforms; jumping motion is too quick
- The boundaries of the animation are not consistent. (players seem to be walking on air sometimes.)
- Not sure what most of the icons are
- Used directional controls


3rd tester:
- Which one is chemist and which one is botanist?
- add button for closing things
- do I need to collect something?
- does the puzzle depend on the letter?
- to make the leaves bigger and more visible
- Wasn’t sure which character was the chemist and which was the botanist
- Used directional controls
- Forgot what the info text was before the puzzle was found 
- Found difficulty jumping between platforms
- Was able to complete the puzzle quickly 
- Floor – user felt they needed to go to the right bottom side of the page
- Add something to show that the elements/ compounds are special and need to be found



### Heuristic Evaluation: 

| **Interface**            | **Issue**                                                           | **Heuristic(s)**                                    | **Frequency** (0-4) | **Impact** (0-4) | **Persistence** (0-4) | **Severity** = (F+I+P)/3 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|--------------------|----------------|--------------------|---------------------|
| **Character Movement**  | Better if character comes into the screen instead of from the outside | Aesthetic and minimalist design                   | 2                  | 1              | 2                  | **1.67**            |
| **Pop-up Information**  | Don’t like the pop-up info – game pauses when info pops up the screen | Flexibility and efficiency of use                 | 3                  | 3              | 3                  | **3.00**            |
| **Text Display**        | Too many words and long info                                     | Aesthetic and minimalist design                   | 2                  | 2              | 2                  | **2.00**            |
| **Item Interaction**    | Can’t see if the character is grabbing the items               | Visibility of system status                       | 3                  | 3              | 3                  | **3.00**            |
| **Screen Layout/Camera** | Screen is too small to see the user – better to zoom in where the character is – only see one floor at a time | Recognition rather than recall | 3 | 2 | 3 | **2.67** |
| **HUD/Icons**           | Don’t know what the different icons are/what they really have to do | Match between system and real world, Visibility of system status | 4 | 3 | 4 | **3.67** |



## Meeting
After completing the lab, we met again to discuss our goals for the week. We decided to focus on improving the UI, as most of the feedback from students highlighted issues related to aesthetics and design.
