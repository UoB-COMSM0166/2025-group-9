# Week 5 Meeting

## Final Game Idea
Our group decided to meet up after the lab to discuss the final game idea. Below are the notes from that meeting:
- Two UoB science students (chemist and botanist) are trapped in an abandoned lab.
- They must find 4 compounds (2 chemical, 2 plants) to create a cure for a spreading virus.
- Both students are already sick from their experiment, and their health deteriorates over time.
- Add a health diagram or visual indicator to show their health levels.
- Reduce character speed as their health decreases.
- Character 1 collects Compound Y (chemical), Character 2 collects Compound X (botanical).
- The final compound is located near the end of the maze.
- Maze has two floors: Chemistry Floor (chemical compounds) and Botany Floor (plant compounds).
- Moving platforms (lifts) connect the two floors.
- Characters must complete math puzzles or science-based challenges to collect compounds.
- Certain zones in the maze can only be completed by specific characters.
- Challenges take up only the side of the screen corresponding to the character completing them.
- Obstacles include:
-   Lights losing power (reduced visibility).
-   Pixelated visuals (glitchy environment).
-   Shifting platforms (lifts moving up and down).
-   Pushing cabinets or jumping over gaps.
- Both characters must survive and collect all compounds to win.
- If one character dies, the game restarts.
- Timer speeds up (twice as fast) after collecting a compound.
- Characters start in different areas of the maze and are responsible for their own compounds.
- Visual style: Pixelated, retro, or glitchy aesthetic.


## Next Steps
During the same meeting, we then dicussed our goals for the current week. As we felt that we were behind, we split tasks inorder to catch up and start developing the game by the start of reading week.

1. Introduction - Vera
2. Requirements section (epics and user stories) - Hakeem and Satvika
3. Design section (class diagram) - Maram and Hadeel

We also decided to have a teams meeting at the end of the week to catch up and plan our sprints.
