# Week 8

During our lab this week, we conducted a quantitative evaluation of the two levels of our game; using the NASA Task Load Index (TLX) and System Usability Survey (SUS).



After the lab session, our team discussed the results of the questionnaires. Based on our responses we redesigned the layout of game and made the puzzles easier to spot.
