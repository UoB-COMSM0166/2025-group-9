# Week 4 Meeting

## Goals
1. Create a final game idea - after talking to other people during the lab we came to the conclusion that our game idea is not creative/unique enough
2. Requirements section 
-   A list of stakeholders
-   Create epics, user stories and acceptance criterias (add this to kanban board)
-   Write 300 word reflection on what our team learned on epics, user stories acceptance criterias and app's context (add to requirements section on repo)

## Lab
The below is what we worked on during the lab session. This is for our original game idea (see Week 3 folder), but after talking to other people we have decided to come up with a different game idea so the below may not be as relevant. 

### Stakeholders
- Players - 8 and up
- Developers
- Tester
- Advertiser e.g App Store

### User Stories/Acceptance Criterias
Players:
- As a player I want the game to be realistic so that I can enjoy it and so that it's fun to look at.
-   As a player I want the game to have good visuals so that its nice to look at.

Tasks:
1. Flight physics e.g. movements at different altitudes, flight turning and baking etc. 
2. Weather physics e.g. effects of the wind/rain/clouds on the flights and overall visuals, turbulence
3. Flights look bigger or smaller depending on altitude.
4. Keep the background running at different speeds to show illusion of forward moving planes.
5. Slightly pixelated for the arcade feel.  
  
- As a player I want to have clear instructions so that I know how to play the game.
-   Given I am new to the game when I have an untimed test run then I can learn how to play the game.

Developers:
- As a developer I want the game to be challenging so that the players are interested and want to play more.
-   As a developer I want to add ground obstacles so that it's more challenging for the player.
- As a developer I want the game to not take up too much space so that it is efficient to run.
- As a developer I want the game to be intuitive so that the players would want to play again and again.

Advertiser:
- As an advertiser I don't want to the game to be too graphic so that more people from different age groups can play.
