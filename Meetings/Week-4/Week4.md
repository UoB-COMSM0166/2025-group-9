# Week 4 Meeting

## Goals
1. Create a final game idea - after talking to other people during the lab we came to the conclusion that our game idea is not creative/unique enough
2. Requirements section 
-   A list of stakeholders
-   Create epics, user stories and acceptance criterias (add this to kanban board)
-   Write 300 word reflection on what our team learned on epics, user stories acceptance criterias and app's context (add to requirements section on repo)

## Lab
The below is what we worked on during the lab session. This is for our original game idea (see Week 3 folder), but after talking to other people we have decided to come up with a different game idea so the below may not be as relevant. 

### Stakeholders
- Players - 8 and up
- Developers
- Tester
- Advertiser e.g App Store

### User Stories/Acceptance Criterias
Players:
- As a player I want the game to be realistic so that I can enjoy it and so that it's fun to look at.
-   As a player I want the game to have good visuals so that its nice to look at.

Tasks:
1. Flight physics e.g. movements at different altitudes, flight turning and baking etc. 
2. Weather physics e.g. effects of the wind/rain/clouds on the flights and overall visuals, turbulence
3. Flights look bigger or smaller depending on altitude.
4. Keep the background running at different speeds to show illusion of forward moving planes.
5. Slightly pixelated for the arcade feel.  
  
- As a player I want to have clear instructions so that I know how to play the game.
-   Given I am new to the game when I have an untimed test run then I can learn how to play the game.

Developers:
- As a developer I want the game to be challenging so that the players are interested and want to play more.
-   As a developer I want to add ground obstacles so that it's more challenging for the player.
- As a developer I want the game to not take up too much space so that it is efficient to run.
- As a developer I want the game to be intuitive so that the players would want to play again and again.

Advertiser:
- As an advertiser I don't want to the game to be too graphic so that more people from different age groups can play.


## Fireboy & Watergirl Potential additions/changes
Switch from a space battle game to a co-op puzzle-platformer, where elemental siblings (Fire & Water) work together to solve temple challenges by combining their unique abilities. Here are some game ideas:
1. Deep Storyline & Character Development
- Add a background story explaining why Fireboy and Watergirl are in the temple.
- Introduce new characters and a main goal beyond simply progressing to the next level.
- Players uncover secrets of the temple as they progress.

2. Story-Driven Levels
- Levels evolve with the storyline, such as rescuing a character or revealing hidden temple lore.

3. Swappable & Merging Abilities
- Players can temporarily swap abilities, e.g., Fireboy gaining water abilities and vice versa.
- Parallel Worlds Mechanic: Players navigate two realms (Fire World & Water World) and must merge into a single character to solve         specific puzzles.

4. Time-Based Challenges
 - Introduce levels with time limits, requiring players to complete objectives before the countdown ends.
 - Include a race mode where players compete against each other to complete levels faster.

5. Math-Based Puzzles
 - Simple math challenges like arranging numbers or solving equations to unlock doors.

6. Dark Levels & Light Mechanics
 - Dark-themed levels where players must rely on limited light sources (e.g., fire or glowing objects) to navigate.

7. Ability Upgrades & Power-Ups
  - Players can upgrade abilities over time, such as faster movement and improved jumping height.
  - Introduce power-ups like speed boosts or temporary invincibility.

8. Gameplay Twists & New Mechanics
  - Board Rotation: Flip the entire level 180Â°, forcing players to adapt to a new perspective.
  - Timed Power Switches: Abilities swap automatically after a certain period, adding strategic complexity.
