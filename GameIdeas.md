# Game Ideas

## Connect 4
- Add a “Blind mode”, in the middle of the game, all pieces flip to (black) to hide their color and lasting for 2 rounds before turning back to their original color.
- Add “Undo button” and each player can use it once per game.

## Pac-Man
- The player takes on the role of the ghost aiming to trap Pac-Man.
- The maze changes randomly - wall shifts, pathways open and close.
- The player will gain power-ups throughout the game such as, speed boost or temporary wall formation, to help trap Pac-Man.

## Tetris
- Instead of clearing lines, the goal is to stack Tetris pieces into a tall, stable tower.
- Each piece has its own weight and shape, and the tower sways or shifts based on how you stack it.
- Poor placement can cause the tower to tilt or collapse entirely.
- As the game progresses new pieces fall faster, and random events like wind gusts occurs.
- The game ends when the tower falls or you run out of time.

## Flappy Bird
- Instead of a bird it’s a fish.
- The player controls a fish swimming through underwater obstacles.
- The fish can swim upward by tapping, and it slowly sinks when not tapped.
- Environmental hazards such as underwater currents and rising tides can change the positioning of obstacles.
- Players can gain power-ups like a bubble shield or speed boost.

## Battleship
- Each player has their own grid where they secretly place their ships.
- The goal is to “sink” all of your opponent’s ships by guessing where they’re hiding and firing at those spots.
- The player who sinks all the opponent’s ships wins the game.

Here’re some additional Ideas to make the game more exciting:
- Add a storyline to motivate players (protecting a naval base or invading an island)
- Allow ships to move during the game to avoid getting hit.
- Add weapons like missiles that destroy an entire row or ship, bombs that cover a square area or storms cause massive damage across a big zone.
- For rewards, give players things like a radar to reveal part of an opponent’s ship, extra shots in one turn, or even the ability to repair their own ship.
- Add weather effects like fog or high waves that temporarily block shots.
